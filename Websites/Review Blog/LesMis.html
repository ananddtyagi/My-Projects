    <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
    <p>This movie musical is set in 19th century France. This musical follows Jean Valjean being hunted down by Javert, a policeman. In the movie Jean Valjean starts out as a slave but then leaves (escapes) to go on to better things and eventually does become a highly ranked government official. Along with this relationship between Jean and Javert the story of Fantine and Cosette is occurring simultaneously. Fantine, a poor women, works as a women slave or worker making clothes and other things. Fantine looks after Cosette who has to work for a couple (Thénardier and Madme Thénardier) who are thiefs in every manner but run a hotel (where they do most of their thievery). So, this story follows Jean Valjean being chased by Javert, the policeman, and is intertwined with the story of Fantine and Cosette and how they have to get along in the world, and whose story is also intertwined with the Thénardier’s. Also, when young Cosette grows up we see her individual story forming with the boy Marius, a rich boy fighting for the rebels. So as you can see there is a very ingenious plot which is a little confusing but does make sense when you see the movie.<span id="more-1864"></span></p>
    <p><strong>Acting: <span style="line-height:1.4;">5/5</span></strong></p>
    <p>Wow, the actors and actresses for this are just fabulous. Being a musical, the movie is 99% singing with like 1%  speech and I would say everyone in this movie did great in singing except maybe Russell Crowe for Javert. Before I move on to individuals props I am just going to list the names of the actor and actresses and their roles: Hugh Jackman plays Jean Valjean, the prisoner who is being chased by Javert, played by Russell Crowe, the angry French Police officer. Then we have Anne Hathaway who play Fantine. Unfortunately she does not make as big an appearance as the others since something happens to her towards the beginning or so of the movie. Then we have Cossette. Little Cossette is played by Isabelle Allen who sort of shows the backround of the older Cossette, who is played by Amanda Seyfried. Now these are the same people but Cossette is shown when she is young and then as a teenager so that is why their are two Cossette’s. After that we have two characters that are mainly thieves but do add some humor to the story. They are Thénardier and Madame Thénardier played by <span style="line-height:1.4;">Sacha Baron</span><span style="line-height:1.4;"> </span><span style="line-height:1.4;">C</span><span style="line-height:1.4;">o</span><span style="line-height:1.4;">h</span><span style="line-height:1.4;">en and</span><span style="line-height:1.4;"> Helena Bonham Carter respectively. After that we have some characters that come to more importance later in the movie who are Éponine played by Samantha Parks and Marius played by Eddie Redmayne. Éponine is the daughter of the Thénardier’s and likes the boy named Marius who is a rich man’s nephew. Even though he is rich enough to not fight, Marius decides to fight with the lower French people for freedom. Eventually Cossette and him cross paths and they fall in love. Then Éponine finds out and then that becomes a mini story in itself so I can’t reveal </span>much<span style="line-height:1.4;"> about that. Well, this is one of the largest casts I have ever written about and so I am going to have to keep the props short. I just have one word for all the actors and actresses in this movie that will probably sum it up: Amazing. </span></p>
    <p><strong>Story: <span style="line-height:1.4;">5/5</span></strong></p>
    <p>Well, as you have probably noticed by now, this movie has a complicated story (I can only imagine how they pulled it off in the play). For the understanding of the story this movie probably gets a 4/5, but since in the end the story makes sense and can be appreciated theirs an extra point for that. The story in general I think is very ingenious. This is because, as I have stated before, the story consists of so many different characters and eventually they all come together to have some sort of connection with each other. I think that is a pretty amazing concept since I have herd of two people or something  meeting and the end it turns out they were  friends when they were kids and that sort of thing happening. But this story is the story of eight different characters that have a crazy relationships with each other but I think that this story was one of the best I have seen been put together.</p>
    <p><strong>Play -&gt; Movie: <span style="line-height:1.4;">5/5</span></strong></p>
    <p>This movie is actually a play turned into a movie. The play itself is very famous and plays in many places. The reason that this is a very interesting movie is because there are not many movies that are musicals and so this was interesting and different to see. One thing I think was so interesting is that this was a musical turned movie. In a musical everything is live and you can’t make a mistake. Everything has to be perfect and hours and hours of practice go into numerous rehearsals day after day. But in a movie if you make a mistake it can be edited out and done again. <span style="line-height:1.4;"> </span><span style="line-height:1.4;">I mean, along with mistake the view is the same in a live show than in a movie where the angles are constantly changing. </span>After watching the movie I wondered if the directors took advantage of this being a movie and I would say they certainly did and they really did a good job with it. As a side note, I loved the ending where they all came together as the people do in the musicals as well. So, props for this miraculous musical turned movie.</p>
    <p><strong>Is it Interesting: <span style="line-height:1.4;">5/5</span></strong></p>
    <p>Since this movie has many twists and turns this movie is very interesting to watch. I personally felt that the fact that in the end all these characters were all some how connected with each other is amazing. I really have already stated a lot in the previous paragraphs about this, but this movie really is great. This movie, along with interest, can make you change your emotions. It can make you cry, laugh (sometimes), feel angry or rebellious or sided with someone and that is a quality I think all movie makers strive for and this movie really did do that for us. In short, this movie is very interesting.</p>
    <p><strong>Overall Rating: 20/20= 100%</strong></p>
    <p>This movie is amazing and really deserves this 100% so go and watch it.</p>
